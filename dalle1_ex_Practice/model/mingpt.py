"""
GPT model:
- the initial stem consists of a combination of token encoding and a positional encoding
- the meat of it is a uniform sequence of Transformer blocks
    - each Transformer is a sequential combination of a 1-hidden-layer MLP block and a self-attention block
    - all blocks feed into a central residual pathway similar to resnets
- the final decoder is a linear projection into a vanilla Softmax classifier
